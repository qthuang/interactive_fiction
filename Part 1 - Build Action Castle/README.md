In this game, you are camping by yourself in a wild wood. You need to find food and fire, while keep yourself away from dangerous things.

There are 3 locations: camping site, woods, and river.

From the camping site, you can get the torch, which is lightable.

From the woods, you can get an apple, and a branch.

You need to use command "craft" to turn the branch in your inventory to bow and arrows.

With bow and arrows, you will able to use "hunt" command to hunt rabbit at the woods and fish at the river.

If you hunt in the woods without bow and arrows, you'll get too close to a snake and got bitten. This is the losing condition.

The winning condition is: have apple in inventory; have torch lit; hunt rabbit and fish.

I make this game with a camping theme because I like camping, although the implementation of this game is not relevant to the real situation at all! I believe turning an item from the inventory to another would be interesting, so I implemented this trail.
